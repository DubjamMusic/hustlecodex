## Key Concepts

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

The system uses an iterative cycle where multiple AI agents with distinct roles collaborate to analyze problems and generate solutions. Each cycle includes input construction, parallel processing, self-critique, moderation, and progression to the next iteration.

### Cross-Domain Integration

All seven domains share unified authentication (SSO), synchronized user data, consistent branding, and centralized AI intelligence. Users can seamlessly move between properties with their progress, purchases, and preferences following them.

### AI-Powered Optimization

The Nexus agents continuously analyze user behavior across all domains to optimize content strategy, pricing, user experience, and resource allocation. This creates a self-improving ecosystem that gets smarter over time.
