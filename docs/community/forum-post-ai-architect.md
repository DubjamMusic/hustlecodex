## Hey everyone 👋

I want to share something I've been working on for months now, and I need this community's help to make it real.

Some of you know me from the BBC "Tagged" documentary. What you might not know is that experience—seeing how many of us struggle with the same challenges, feeling isolated even when we're surrounded by people—lit a fire in me.

**I kept thinking: What if technology could actually help? Not replace human connection, but amplify it. Scale it. Make support accessible when you need it most.**

## What We're Building

**HustleCodeX** isn't just another app or website. It's an ecosystem—seven interconnected platforms designed to meet people wherever they are in their journey:

- A **gamified recovery experience** that makes progress visible and rewarding
- A **community space** where people can connect, share, and support each other (you're in it!)
- **Tools and resources** that actually help, not just generic advice
- A **marketplace** for skills and opportunities
- And yes, even **NFTs** (but the good kind—membership passes that unlock real value, not just speculation)

But here's the thing: at the heart of all of it is **AI**. Not the creepy, replace-humans kind. The kind that learns what you need, suggests what might help, and connects you with the right resources at the right time.

**Think of it like having a team of advisors in your pocket—one who's great with strategy, one who spots problems before they become crises, and one who ties it all together.**

That's the Nexus system. And it's going to change how people experience recovery.

## Why I'm Posting This Here

I could post this job on LinkedIn or some tech job board. But that's not where I want to find this person.

**I want to find someone who *gets it*.**

Someone who understands that behind every user interaction is a real person who's struggling, who's trying, who deserves better than what's out there right now.

Someone who sees this community—this messy, beautiful, honest community—and thinks "I want to build for them."

**Maybe that person is you. Maybe it's someone you know. Maybe it's someone who hasn't found us yet but will see this post shared somewhere.**

## The Role: AI Architect

This is a **founding technical role**. Not just a job—a chance to shape something from the ground up.

### What You'd Actually Do

**Build the brain:** Design and implement the multi-agent AI system that powers decision-making across the entire ecosystem. Three specialized AI agents that debate, critique, and synthesize recommendations—like a virtual boardroom.

**Make it personal:** Create systems that learn from user behavior across all our platforms and use that understanding to deliver genuinely helpful, personalized experiences.

**Solve real problems:** Figure out how to predict when someone's about to give up, what content will resonate with them, what intervention might help. Use AI for good, not just profit.

**Set the foundation:** Make architectural decisions that will shape the company for years. Choose technologies, design systems, establish engineering culture.

### What We're Looking For

**Technical chops:**
- Deep experience with Large Language Models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Expert-level TypeScript/Node.js development
- Understanding of distributed systems and scalability
- Experience with databases, APIs, cloud infrastructure
- Bonus: Multi-agent systems, game development, Web3

**But more importantly:**
- **Empathy:** You understand what it's like to struggle, to need help, to feel alone
- **Mission alignment:** You want your work to matter, not just pad your resume
- **Builder mentality:** You ship things, iterate, learn, improve
- **Communication:** You can explain complex ideas simply
- **Integrity:** You'll have access to sensitive data and must treat it with respect

### What We're Offering

**Money:**
- £60,000 - £90,000 base salary
- 0.5% - 2.0% equity (you'll own a real piece of this)

**Freedom:**
- Work remotely from anywhere in UK/EU
- Flexible hours (we care about output, not when you're online)
- Real autonomy over technical decisions

**Growth:**
- Clear path to CTO/VP Engineering as we scale
- £2,000/year learning budget
- Conference attendance
- Chance to build and lead a team

**Impact:**
- Your code will help real people
- You'll see testimonials from users whose lives changed
- You'll go to sleep knowing your work mattered

## Why This Might Be The Opportunity You've Been Looking For

If you're a developer who's been grinding away at some fintech startup or ad-tech company, building features that make rich people richer...

If you've been thinking "there has to be more than this"...

If you've ever wanted to use your skills for something that actually helps people...

**This is that opportunity.**

You'll work on cutting-edge AI technology (multi-agent systems, LLM orchestration, real-time personalization) while building something that genuinely matters.

You'll be employee #1-3, with all the equity, influence, and growth potential that comes with that.

And you'll be part of a community that will have your back, celebrate your wins, and remind you why this work matters when things get hard.

## The Honest Truth

This won't be easy. We're bootstrapped (for now), moving fast, and figuring things out as we go.

You'll wear multiple hats. You'll make mistakes. You'll have to make decisions with incomplete information.

**But you'll also:**
- Have more impact in 6 months than most people have in their entire careers
- Learn more than you thought possible
- Build something you're genuinely proud of
- Maybe even change some lives along the way

## A Personal Note

I know what it's like to feel stuck. To feel like you're fighting alone. To wonder if things will ever get better.

Technology didn't save me—people did. Community did. Connection did.

**But technology can amplify that.** It can help more people find the support they need. It can make the journey a little less lonely, a little more manageable, a little more hopeful.

That's what we're building. Not a replacement for human connection, but a tool that makes it more accessible, more effective, more powerful.

**And I can't build it alone.**

I need an AI Architect who sees this vision and thinks "I can make that real."

Maybe that's you. Maybe you know them. Either way, I'm grateful you're here, part of this community, part of this journey.

Let's build something special together.
