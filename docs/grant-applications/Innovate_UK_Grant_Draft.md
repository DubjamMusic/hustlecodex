## Project Title: HustleCodeX - AI-Driven Gamification for Addiction Recovery Adherence

### 1. Public Description
HustleCodeX is developing a novel digital therapeutic platform that combines gamification mechanics with Large Language Model (LLM) coaching to improve adherence to addiction recovery protocols. Unlike passive tracking apps, HustleCodeX uses an active "RPG" (Role-Playing Game) framework where users progress in their recovery by completing real-world educational tasks (coding and digital skills). This project aims to validate the efficacy of "skill-acquisition as therapy" in reducing relapse rates among early-stage recovery patients.

### 2. The Innovation
The core innovation lies in the integration of three distinct fields:
1.  **Behavioral Psychology:** Using "sunk cost" bias positively—users invest time building a digital character and skills, making relapse "costly" in the game world.
2.  **Generative AI:** A personalized AI coach ("The Mentor") that analyzes user journal entries and check-ins to provide real-time, context-aware support and quest recommendations.
3.  **EdTech:** Replacing generic "recovery tasks" with high-value vocational training, addressing the socioeconomic determinants of health (unemployment/poverty).

### 3. Technical Approach
*   **Platform:** A progressive web application (PWA) built on Next.js and React, ensuring accessibility across devices.
*   **AI Engine:** Utilisation of the Claude API for natural language understanding and generation, fine-tuned on recovery literature and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles.
*   **Data Analytics:** Real-time tracking of user engagement, skill progression, and sentiment analysis to predict potential relapse risks (e.g., sudden drop in activity or negative sentiment shift).

### 4. Market Awareness
The digital health market is saturated with passive tracking apps (e.g., I Am Sober) or general mental health apps (e.g., Headspace). However, there is a significant gap for "active recovery" tools that address the boredom and lack of purpose often cited as relapse triggers. Our competitor analysis shows no direct rival combining vocational training with recovery support. The global mHealth market is projected to reach £100B+, with addiction treatment being a high-growth vertical.

### 5. Project Plan & Funding Request
We are applying for a **£50,000 Feasibility Study** grant to:
*   **Month 1-2:** Develop the "AI Mentor" prototype and integrate it with the existing gamified learning platform.
*   **Month 3-4:** Conduct a controlled feasibility study with 100 participants (50 active, 50 control) in partnership with UK-based recovery charities.
*   **Month 5-6:** Analyze data on retention rates, skill completion, and self-reported cravings; produce a final report for clinical review.

### 6. Team & Resources
*   **DubjamMusic (Lead):** Experience in digital product development and community building.
*   **Clinical Advisors:** We are establishing an advisory board with addiction specialists from [Placeholder: Local University/NHS Trust].
*   **Technical Team:** Experienced developers in React, Node.js, and AI integration.

### 7. Value for Money
This project represents high value for money as it leverages existing open-source technologies to tackle a costly public health issue. Every individual who maintains recovery and enters the workforce represents a saving of tens of thousands of pounds to the NHS and the wider economy.
