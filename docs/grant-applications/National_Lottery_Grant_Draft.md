## Project Title: HustleCodeX - Digital Skills for Recovery

### 1. Project Summary
HustleCodeX is an innovative digital platform designed to support individuals in addiction recovery by teaching them high-demand coding and digital entrepreneurship skills. By gamifying the learning process and wrapping it in a compelling "cyberpunk recovery" narrative, we transform the often isolating experience of recovery into a collaborative, skill-building adventure. Our project addresses two critical societal needs: the lack of engaging, modern recovery support tools and the digital skills gap in the UK workforce.

### 2. Why is this project needed?
Traditional recovery programs often struggle with retention, particularly among younger demographics who find existing tools passive or outdated. At the same time, individuals in recovery frequently face barriers to employment due to gaps in their CVs or lack of modern skills.
*   **Engagement Gap:** Many recovery apps are simple trackers that fail to provide a sense of progression or purpose.
*   **Employment Barrier:** Unemployment is a significant risk factor for relapse. Providing a clear pathway to digital careers offers both financial stability and a renewed sense of identity.
*   **Community Need:** There is a lack of safe, sober digital spaces where individuals can collaborate on productive projects rather than just discussing their struggles.

### 3. Who will benefit?
Our primary beneficiaries are individuals in the UK currently in recovery from substance abuse, with a specific focus on:
*   Young adults (18-35) who are digitally native but underemployed.
*   Individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds who lack access to traditional coding bootcamps (which often cost £6,000+).
*   Recovery communities and support groups looking for modern tools to engage their members.

### 4. What will the funding pay for?
We are requesting funding to support the "Level 1: The Awakening" phase of our project:
*   **Content Development (£15,000):** Creation of the first 20 hours of gamified coding curriculum tailored for neurodiverse learners.
*   **Platform Development (£20,000):** Finalizing the MVP web platform, including the community voting system and secure user authentication.
*   **Pilot Program (£10,000):** Running a 3-month pilot with 50 users from partner recovery centers in the UK, including hardware support (laptops/tablets) for those in need.
*   **Impact Measurement (£5,000):** Implementing analytics to track skill acquisition and recovery milestones.

### 5. Expected Outcomes
*   **Skill Acquisition:** 80% of pilot participants will complete the introductory HTML/CSS module.
*   **Improved Well-being:** Participants will report a 30% increase in "sense of purpose" and "community connection" (measured via standard recovery metrics).
*   **Employment Pathways:** 5 participants will secure internships or freelance work through our partner network.

### 6. Sustainability
Following the grant period, HustleCodeX will transition to a sustainable freemium model. The core recovery features will remain free, while advanced career-focused modules and cosmetic items will generate revenue. We are also exploring B2B partnerships with NHS trusts and private rehab clinics to license the platform as a therapeutic tool.
